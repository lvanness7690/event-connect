## Description

This project aimed to develop a comprehensive full-stack interactive application, adhering to a set of criteria including:

- Utilizing Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.
- Employing Handlebars.js as the template engine.
- Implementing MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.
- Incorporating both GET and POST routes for data retrieval and addition.
- Introducing at least one new library, package, or technology.
- Following a folder structure conforming to the MVC paradigm.
- Integrating authentication using express-session and cookies.
- Ensuring security by protecting API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.
- Deployment on Heroku with data.
- Designing a polished UI that is responsive and interactive, accepting and responding to user input.
- Adhering to good-quality coding standards.

The application utilizes Ticketmaster's Events API, chosen for its diverse functionalities and versatile content. The primary objective was to enable users to access Ticketmaster's API, featuring a dynamic database of musical artists, alongside local city search functionality. Additionally, a message board was integrated for users attending each show to communicate and share experiences, fostering community and connection through music.

Event Connect's current components include:
- Home Page
- Login and Registration functionality for new and existing users
- Date and city picker to reveal upcoming shows at venues
- Message board for users to communicate and share experiences

The development process began with building the database, followed by setting up routes and user pages as a template. The API integration was later performed to allow for a more flexible design. Handlebars played a significant role in forming the website's foundation and managing the creation of various pages and client-side input. Throughout development, challenges regarding the MVC architecture were encountered, leading to collaborative efforts to refactor the code for a cleaner and more streamlined application.

## Installation

To install Event Connect, follow these steps:

## Technologies Used

This application is powered by Node.js (v16.19.1), Express.js (v.14.18.2), JavaScript, MySQL, Sequelize (ORM), and Handlebars (template engine). It utilizes the node package manager (npm) dependencies sequelize (v6.31.1), mysql2 (v3.3.0), express (v4.18.2), dotenv (16.0.3v), nodemon (v2.0.22), bcrypt (v.5.1.0), connect-session-sequelize(v.7.1.6), eslint (v.8.40.0), express-handlebars (v7.0.7), express-session (v1.17.3), and moment (v2.29.4). Jest (v.29.5.0) is installed for future unit testing. Also, the Insomnia application was utilized to test the functionality of routes within the program.

## Live Application

The original Heroku deployment has been retired. This MySQL-backed MVC application can be run locally by following the installation steps above with valid database and Ticketmaster API environment variables.

## Usage

1. **Registration and Login**:
   - Users can register for a new account or log in using their existing credentials.
   - Navigate to the registration page and fill out the required information to create a new account.
   - After registration, users can log in using their username and password.

2. **Exploring Events**:
   - Upon logging in, users are redirected to the home page where they can explore upcoming events.
   - Use the date and city picker interface to select a date and city to view relevant events.

3. **Viewing Event Details**:
   - Click on an event card to view more details about the event, including venue information, date, and time.

4. **Interacting with the Message Board**:
   - For each event, there is a message board where users attending the event can communicate and share experiences.
   - Navigate to the message board section of the event page to view and participate in discussions.

5. **Posting Messages**:
   - Logged-in users can post messages on the message board to share thoughts, ask questions, or engage with other attendees.
